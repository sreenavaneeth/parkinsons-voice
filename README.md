Inspiration/Background
Over ten million people worldwide are diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), with studies suggesting that there are many more people who are not diagnosed due to the low accuracy of modern day testing methods (53% accurate). Recent studies have shown that Voice can play a strong role in detecting early PD symptoms, and so we set out to develop a tool to help doctors leverage this advance in technology to assist them to more accurately diagnose PD patients.

What it does
Our app works as a tool for doctors to aid them to detect early signs of Parkinson’s Disease in Patients. It does so by taking an audio file of someone speaking and passing it through to our Custom built Machine Learning Model, there it computes the discrete Fourier transform of the audio file, and analyses the patient’s speech based on 22 features. The ML instance returns the probability of the user showing early sings of the Parkinson’s Disease. It also returns the scores of each of the 22 features so that the doctor can have a detailed explanation as to how the probability was calculated. All of this is displayed in the Dashboard that the doctor would be able to access.
